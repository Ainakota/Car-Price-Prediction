# Car-Price-Prediction

To determine a car's worth depending on a range of factors, a model to forecast its price should be created. The price of a car is influenced by a number of variables, including the manufacturer, model, year, gearbox, mileage, fuel type, seller type, and owner type. As a result, prior to buying Â an automobile, it is essential to understand its true market value.

We employed feature engineering in this project because, when the model was fitted to the training data and tested on the test data, it was discovered that the predicted values' scores varied greatly.

When the model is either undertrained or overtrained, feature engineering is used. To eliminate the attributes that affect the dependent attribute while fitting into the model, feature engineering aids in identifying the factors that influence the target value, in this case the cost of the car, as well as the factors that have a negative influence on the target value.

Since the model in this project is undertrained, we employ feature engineering to get around the problem.
